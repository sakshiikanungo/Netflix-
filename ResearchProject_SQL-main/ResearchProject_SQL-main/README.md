# ResearchProject_SQL
Data analysis on Netflix dataset using MySQL

In this project, I got the opportunity to study, develop a few business objectives based on a real-life dataset (Netflix Movies & Series data - Source: Kaggle), 
and apply SQL concepts to retrieve insights from it. 
I have used MySQL Workbench for primary data modelling and querying the database and used cmd prompt for loading the data.
